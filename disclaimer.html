            <h2>⚠️ Important Notice</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>The information provided by Debloat is for general informational 
              and educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.</strong>
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Not Medical Advice</h2>
          <p>
            Debloat provides food analysis, nutritional scores, and wellness insights 
            based on AI-powered scanning technology. This information is intended to 
            help you make more informed decisions about your food choices but should 
            <strong>NOT</strong> be considered as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Medical diagnosis or treatment</li>
            <li>Professional dietary or nutritional advice</li>
            <li>A substitute for consultation with qualified healthcare professionals</li>
            <li>A replacement for professional medical examination, diagnosis, or treatment</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Health Scores and Metrics</h2>
          <p>
            Our app provides various health-related scores and metrics including, but not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bloating Potential:</strong> An estimate of how likely a food may cause bloating</li>
            <li><strong>Inflammation Score:</strong> An indicator of potential inflammatory response</li>
            <li><strong>Digestion Rating:</strong> An assessment of digestive ease</li>
            <li><strong>Gas Potential:</strong> An estimate of gas-producing likelihood</li>
            <li><strong>Fluid Balance:</strong> Impact on body's hydration levels</li>
            <li><strong>Skin Health:</strong> Potential effects on skin condition</li>
            <li><strong>Nutrient Analysis:</strong> Estimated nutritional content</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These scores are generated using AI algorithms based on general nutritional 
            data and research. They are <strong>approximations only</strong> and may not 
            accurately reflect how a specific food will affect your individual body.
          </p>

          <h2>Individual Variation</h2>
          <p>
            Every person's body responds differently to foods. Factors that influence 
            individual responses include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal health conditions and medical history</li>
            <li>Allergies and food sensitivities</li>
            <li>Medications and supplements being taken</li>
            <li>Gut microbiome composition</li>
            <li>Genetic factors</li>
            <li>Age, weight, and overall health status</li>
            <li>Existing dietary patterns</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The scores and information provided by Debloat do not account for these 
            individual variations and should not be relied upon as personalized health guidance.
          </p>

          <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
          <p>
            While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>AI-based food recognition may occasionally misidentify foods</li>
            <li>Nutritional data is based on general databases and may not reflect exact product formulations</li>
            <li>Scores are algorithmic estimates, not laboratory-verified results</li>
            <li>Information may become outdated as nutritional science evolves</li>
            <li>Restaurant and processed food variations may not be accurately captured</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We make no warranties or representations about the accuracy, reliability, 
            completeness, or timeliness of any information provided through the app.
          </p>

          <h2>Consult Healthcare Professionals</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals</strong> before:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Making significant changes to your diet</li>
            <li>Starting any new dietary regimen</li>
            <li>If you have existing health conditions</li>
            <li>If you experience adverse reactions to any foods</li>
            <li>If you are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant</li>
            <li>If you have eating disorders or disordered eating patterns</li>
            <li>If you take medications that may interact with certain foods</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your doctor, registered dietitian, or other qualified healthcare provider 
            can offer personalized advice based on your specific health needs and circumstances.
